# BuildingEscape
This is the first game made for Unreal. The player is locked in a room and must find a way out. A hint is given to the player to open
the door. The hint is a red light on the floor that highlights a trigger event box. The box opens when over a certain amount of
weight is in the trigger box area. If the player stands in the trigger box area the door will open but it the player leaves the box the 
door will shut. The player has to grab enough items and put them in the trigger event area so that the door stays opens so the player can 
get out of the room.
